# SOCIAL-MEDIA-UI-TOOL
Social media profiles typically  display a user’s basic information including their name, username, follower count, and any links to other profiles they may have.  In some cases, profiles may also include a bio or short description of the user.

Hover interactions can be used to reveal additional information on a profile page. When a user hovers over an element, such as the follower count or a social media link, a tooltip or popover can appear to display more details. For example, hovering over the follower count could reveal a list of the user’s followers, or hovering over a social media link could show a preview of the user’s profile on that platform.

Here are some additional details that could be revealed in a hover interaction on a social media profile page:

Following: A list of people the user is following
Bio: A short description of the user
Photos: A preview of the user's photos
Friends: A list of the user's friends (if applicable)
Mutual friends: A list of friends that the current user has in common with the profile owner
Including hover interactions can help to improve the user experience of a social media profile page by providing users with additional information on demand. By using hover interactions, you can avoid cluttering the profile page with too much information, while still giving users the ability to learn more about the profile owner if they choose to do so.
